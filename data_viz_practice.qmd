```
```{r}

# in ^ facet_wrap(sex ~ tail) means sex is the x axis and tail is the y axis. the "~" is the syntax for telling operation how to facet

```

# geom_bar and geom_col both create a bar graph but geom_bar will count the values and order them by frequency, in geom_col we would have to manually get the count first.
